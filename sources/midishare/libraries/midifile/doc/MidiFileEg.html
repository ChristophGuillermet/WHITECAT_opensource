<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1">The</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">library
is composed of two sets of function, one for reading and the other
for writing Midi Files.<BR>

</U><FONT SIZE="-1">The file must exits to read it. One must open
it for reading by a call to <B>MidiFileOpen</B> with the mode
<B>MidiFileRead</B>. Only reading operations are possible.<BR>

</FONT><U>2.1.2. Reading track by track&nbsp;:<BR>
</U><FONT SIZE="-1">After a call to <B>MidifileOpen</B>, (in the
<B><I>MidifileAppend mode</I></B>) a full track can be read to
a MidiShare sequence with <B>MidiFileReadTrack</B> who return
the sequence. The sequence is allocated by <B>MidiFileReadTrack</B>.
The caller must free the sequence with <B>MidiFreeSeq </B>after
using it.With <B>MidiFileReadTrack, </B>the track events<B> </B>from
the first to the last, are allocated in the same order in the
sequence. Several successives track may be read using successives

<BR>
</FONT><U>2.1.3. Reading a track event by event&nbsp;:<BR>
</U><FONT SIZE="-1">As an alternative to read the events of a
track, one may use the following functions, <B>MidiFileChooseTrack,</B>
<B>MidiFileOpenTrack</B>,<B>MidiFileReadEv</B> and <B>MidiFileCloseTrack</B>.
With these functions events are read one by one. <B>MidiFileChooseTrack</B>
set the file pointer to the beginning of the designated track.<BR>
<BR>
The function<B> MidFileOpenTrack</B> open a track and must be
used after a call to the function <B>MidiFileChooseTrack</B> or
<B>MidiFileCloseTrack</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>MidiFileReadEv</B> read an event from the current track. The
track must opened with <B>MidFileOpenTrack</B> before the reading
of the first event. Several successives events may be read with
successives call to <B>MidiFileReadEv</B>.<BR>
<BR>
When the event read is the last from the track, a next call to
<B>MidiFileReadEv</B> automaticaly close the track. The macro
<B>IsTrackOpen</B> informs if a track is opened. So if a end of
track was dectected , it is not necessary to use <B>MidiFileCloseTrack

<BR>
</FONT></B>T<FONT SIZE="-1">he following paragrah give you important
informations about the date of events of the Midi file standard
and about the date used by the library functions.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><U>3.1. Events date in a Midi File:<BR>
</U></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
The event date in a standard Midi file is a value relative to
the date of the previous event. The date of the first event of
a track is relative to zero ie relative to the beginning of the
track.<BR>
<BR>
example:<BR>
Let a track composed of 3 events with the respective date to the
previous one.<BR>
<BR>
ev1: relative date: 10 <BR>
ev2: relative date: 25 <BR>
ev3: relative date: 5 <BR>
<BR>
Event ev1 must be played at the date 10 relative to the beginning
of the track.<BR>
Event ev2 must be played at the date 10+25=35 relative to the
beginning of the track.<BR>
Event ev3 must be played at the date 35+5=40 relative to the beginning
of the track.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U>3.1.1. Time unit date representation in MIDIFile<BR>
</U><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
Time unit to represent the dates of events is indicated by the
field <B>time</B> of the MIDIFile descriptor (returned by <B>MidiFileOpen</B>
or <B>MidiFileCreate</B>).<BR>
<BR>
The Midi file standard agree with 2 representation modes of unit
time. Unit may be expressed in fraction of a second in a representation
which correspond to SMPTE. This mode is useful to represent a
collection of meta events like Cue Point or other events which
are suitable in videos films or movies.<BR>
<BR>
Otherwise, time unit may be expressed in Pulses Per Quarter Note
(PPQN). This mode of representation asociated with the <B>tempo</B>
meta event is fited to represent the date of musical events sequence
or song. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U>3.1.2. Unit: fraction of a second<BR>
</U><FONT SIZE="-1">The macro <B>smpte(f)</B> return <B>true</B>
when the field time represents time in fraction of a second.<BR>
<BR>
The macro<B> frame_par_sec(f)</B> return the number of frames
per second, <BR>
(The nomber is a negative value expressed in 2 complement form).<BR>
</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI TYPE="disc"><FONT SIZE="-1">-24: correspond to 24 frames
  per seconde</FONT>
  <LI TYPE="disc"><FONT SIZE="-1">-25: correspond to 25 frames
  per seconde</FONT>
  <LI TYPE="disc"><FONT SIZE="-1">-29: correspond to 30 (drop)
  frames per second</FONT>
  <LI TYPE="disc"><FONT SIZE="-1">-30: correspond to 30 frames
  per second<BR>
  </FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
The macro <B>ticks_par_frame(f)</B> return the number of pulses
per frame, f is the pointer on the MIDIFile descriptor. Knowing
that the date of an event is expressed in pulses per frame, the
two macros <B>frame_par_sec</B> and <B>ticks_par_frame</B> must
be used to evaluate the date in fraction of a second.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U>3.1.3. Unit: number of Pulses Per Quarter Note (PPQN)<BR>
</U><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
The macro <B>smpte(f)</B> return <B>false</B> when time represents
unit in pulses per quarter note. The macro ticks_par_quarterNote(f)
return the number of pulses per quarter note (PPQN). f is the
pointer on the MIDIFile decriptor.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><U>3.2. Event date returned by MidiFileReadEv:<BR>
</U></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
The date of an event returned by <B>MidiFileReadEv</B> is evaluated
like this:<BR>
<BR>
The date of an event is the sum of all the relatives dates of
the previous events. The result is a date relative to zero. That
is the date relative to the beginning of the track. This is the
date to which the event must be played.<BR>
<BR>
Example:<BR>
Let a track composed of 3 events with owned date relative to the
previous one.<BR>
ev1: date: 10 ev2: date: 25 ev3: date : 5 <BR>
<BR>
On reading of the 1er event, the event date returned is :10<BR>
On reading of the 2d event, the event date returned is :35 (10+25)<BR>
On reading of the 3rd event, the event date returned is :40 (35+5)<BR>
<BR>
The unit time of the date is indicated by the field time witch
may be read with the macros described in the previous paragraph.
To obtain an event, one must read the previous events from the
beginning of the track to the target event. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><U>3.3. Event date written by MidiFileWriteEv:<BR>
</U></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
The date of an event written by <B>MidiFileReadEv</B></FONT> <FONT
 SIZE="-1">is relative to the previous written event. The function
assume that the date owned by the event to write is relative to
zero ie relative to the beginning of the track.<BR>
<BR>
The date of the written event is evaluated like this:<BR>
date (written_ev) = date (ev_to_write) - date (previous_written_ev)<BR>
<BR>
Example:<BR>
Let a sequence composed of 3 events with the owned date relative
to the beginning of the track. <BR>
ev1: date: 10 ev2: date: 35 ev3: date: 40 <BR>
<BR>
The date of the 1er written event(ev1) is: 10<BR>
The date of the 2nd written event(ev2) is: 25 (35 - 10)<BR>
The date of the 3rd written event(ev3) is: 5 (40 - 35)<BR>
<BR>
The function assume that the unit time of the date is indicated
by the field time witch may be read with the macros described
in the previous paragraph. So to be complient to the standard
Midi file and if it is necessary the caller must normalize the
variable time and the date of the event to write before a call
<B>MidiFileWriteEv. <BR>
