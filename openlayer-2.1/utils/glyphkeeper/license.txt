 Bundled 3-rd party software
 ---------------------------

Glyph Keeper source distribution contains a number of files that are not
created by me:

 - FreeType library source code, under "freetype" directory. It is required
   for compiling Glyph Keeper, although you may use your own copy of FreeType
   instead. I use and distribute it in agreement with FreeType license located
   in "freetype/FTL.txt" file. See the "freetype/readme.Kirr-mod.txt" file for
   the list of my modifications.

 - Example font "DejaVu Sans" version 2.14, located in "fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf"
   file. Check its the readme "fonts/DejaVu readme.txt" and license
   "fonts/DejaVu licene.txt" for more information about it.

 - Allegro font "fonts/demofont.pcx". It is used by Allegro benchmark program,
   a part of Glyph Keeper benchmark suite. To say the truth I don't remember
   where it came from. I believe it came from Allegro library examples which
   is a giftware. Corerect me if I am wrong.

 - AllegroFont 1.9.2 library in "benchmark/alfont.c" file (slightly modified).
   It is used by a benchmark program to compare performance of Glyph Keeper
   with AllegoFont. It is created by Javier Gonzalez, and distributed under
   FreeType license. (See the source for copyright info).



 FreeType note
 -------------

As using Glyph Keeper requires you to use FreeType, you must also comply
with FreeType license. Glyph Keeper license does not substitute FreeType
license for you!

Please check the FreeType license located in "freetype/license.txt" file in
Glyph Keeper source archive if you are using FreeType bundled with Glyph
Keeper. If you are using FreeType already installed on your system, refer to
its license instead.

I include FreeType 2.2.1 source with Glyph Keeper source distribution. It is
located in "freetype" directory. I did not write any code there. I include it
for convenience of those who don't have FreeType installed on their system.
I use and distribute it together with Glyph Keeper under the terms of FreeType
license, located in "freetype/FTL.txt" file.



 Patent note 1
 -------------

There is an important potential patent issue involved in using FreeType, and
therefore Glyph Keeper. It is best explained on FreeType project web-site
here: http://www.freetype.org/patents.html

Briefly, you should be careful if you are using TrueType bytecode interpreter
patented by Apple. It is disabled (turned OFF) by default in FreeType bundled
with Glyph Keeper. This means Glyph Keeper will not render some fonts as
beautifully as they are rendered by MacOS or Windows.

To activate bytecode interpreter (at your own risk) do the following:
Open header file "include/freetype/config/ftoption.h", and find this line:

/* #define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER */ 

(It is commented out, which means bytecode interpreter is disabled and you are
safe, but some fonts may look bad)

To activate bytecode interpreter, change that line to:

#define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER 

And re-compile FreeType and Glyph Keeper (and your program if you are linking
statically). Then bytecode interpreter will be enabled, and some fonts may
look better.



 Patent note 2
 -------------

My FreeType build has sub-pixel rendering (a.k.a. LCD rendering, or ClearType)
disabled by default. It is patented by Microsoft, so you should be careful
with it. If you want to activate it, open the header file
"include/freetype/config/ftoption.h", find this line that sais:

/* #define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING */

and change it to

#define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING

Don't forget to re-compile FreeType and Glyph Keeper if you change it. Note
that Glyph Keeper does not use sub-pixel rendering at the moment, but it may
change in future.
