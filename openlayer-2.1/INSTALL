INSTALLATION

Before compiling ensure you have the following installed and in your path:
- An ANSI C++ compiler
- OpenGL Library
- Allegro Library
- AllegroGL Library
- Freetype library version 2.1.10 or greater
- Png library
- Zlib library

NOTES:

- The build system is currently being moved from cbuild to cmake (http://www.cmake.org)

- You can still use the cbuild system however it's been reported not to work on some systems
	* For more information on the build utility known as cbuild go to http://awiki.tomasu.org/bin/view/Main/CBUILD

- It is recommended that you use the internal font renderer but if you insist on using GlyphKeeper it should be like this:
	* GlyphKeeper specifically built for ALLEGROGL
	* the allegrogl version should be named libglyph-agl.a
	* The sources have now been included with openlayer in the utils/glyphkeeper directory
	* You can build it manually or try using cbuild passing 'glyphkeeper' as a param

- For precompiled versions of the library please see http://openlayer.berlios.de for more info.

- If no package exists for your compiler you'll have to compile OpenLayer's source files and
  include them in the same archive. Also download the required external libraries and follow the
  installation instructions included with them.

Compilation with cmake:

Create a temporary directory in the root directory of where OpenLayer is.
Change into it then do the following from the command line:

Linux/Unix/OSX:
ccmake ../
cofigure it to your hearts content and then generate the makefiles.
Then you can proceed to do make && make install

Windows:
you can run cmakesetup from anywhere as long as you point the source
directory to where OpenLayer is and the binary directory to the temporary
location you made above.
You can have the setup create makefiles for MinGW or MSYS 
(CYGWIN generated makefiles will be worked on later).
Or you can choose to do MSVC project files (which is currently WIP).
Then just configure and then hit ok.
You can then proceed to compile them via make or use msvc to open the openlayer.sln if you created msvc
project files.

To Use:

- Read the provided documentation found in the Manual folder to know how to use the library

- #include <OpenLayer.hpp> in your project's sources

	LINUX/*NIX and MACOSX
- Link your projects with: `openlayer-config --libs` if you need the flags do `openlayer-config --cflags`
	
	WINDOWS
- Link your projects with:
	"-lopenlayer -lglyph-agl -lfreetype -lpng -lz -lagl -lalleg -luser32 -lgdi32 -lglu32 -lopengl32"
	If you have issues with freetype and get messages like: .... #include expects "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
	you need to pass in the freetype2 dir location when building, ie: "-I%MINGDIR%\include\freetype2"
